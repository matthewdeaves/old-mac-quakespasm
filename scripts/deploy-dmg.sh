# deploy-dmg.sh - path-stable shim, see scripts/pick-build-host.sh's header
# for why this is a shim.
#
# Two build-host#105 pilot findings (alephone#43) both apply here:
# - DMG_PORT_CONF must be set explicitly, same reason as smoke-dmg.sh's shim.
# - deploy-dmg.sh resolves a bare version arg, or the newest dist/*.dmg when
#   given none, relative to ITS OWN location -- the pin cache once wrapped,
#   not this repo. old-mac-build-host's generated jobs call this with no
#   version arg at all ("$REPO/scripts/deploy-dmg.sh" "$h"), relying on the
#   newest-in-dist/ default, so this shim resolves that itself, from this
#   repo's real dist/, and always passes an explicit full path through.
